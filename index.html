     <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <p>Hi, as you can all see, my name is Nathan. I am 22 years old, and one of four boys. 
        I am the second oldest, my oldest brother, Tj is 26, my younger brothers are Kyle, 19, and Dylan, 11. 
        I recetnly moved out of my house to live with my girlfriend of almost 4 years, Jennifer. 
        We do not have a place of our own, I just moved into her family home. We have 2 dogs, 
        3 cats, 4 rats, and a bunny, so we have quite a few pets.</p>
     <p>I have already completed 2 and a half years of college at JJC. At JJC, I completed my 
         Associates in Applied Science for Game Design and Devlopment. I never intended that to 
         be my final education goal, as an AAS is not gunna do much to get me into a career, also game 
         design has become less of a goal for me as I once thought it would be. I transfered to Lewis last 
         year, and am now pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, and I am focusing on Software Engineering. 
         This is my final year at Lewis, and I am hopefully not to far off from a career.</p>
     <h3>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>How to effectivly design web pages</li>
             <li>How to design web pages that look decent</li>
             <li>How to incorporate JavaScrip into HTML pages</li>
             <li>How to utilize APIs</li>
         </ul>

     <h3>My Favorite Hobbies</h3>
     <p>Probably my favorite hobby is Gaming. I have playing games since I was child, and have 
         not had a point were I wasn't gaming. Gaming is also what has driven my intrest in technology 
         and coding. As stated above, I had aspirations of working on video games. As I have grown older, 
         those dreams faded, but the love I gained from coding has stuck, and now I am looking to be a software engineer.</p>
     <h3>Some of My Favorite Games</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>All of the Souls/Borne Games</li>
             <li>All of the main series Borderlands games</li>
             <li>The Binding of Isaac</li>
             <li>The Witcher series</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Greatest Innovations</h3>
         <ul>
             <li><a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/smartphone-power-compared-to-apollo-432/" 
                target="_blank">Smartphones</a></li>
             <p>Smartphones are so common place that we tend to not think about them too 
                 much, but they are insane compared to computers of the past.</p>
             <li><a href="https://foldingathome.org/"
                target="_blank">Folding at Home</a></li>
             <p>While this is the newest, and maybe "least important" innovation, it 
                 holds a lot of significance to today.Folding at home allows users to offer 
                 their hardware to be used to help decode viruses, and it is currently being used to decode COVID.</p>
             <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"
                target="_blank">The Internet</a></li>
             <p>Similar to smartphones, this is something that we take for granted, but the 
                 avaliablity to send data across the world is an amazing tool.
             </p>
